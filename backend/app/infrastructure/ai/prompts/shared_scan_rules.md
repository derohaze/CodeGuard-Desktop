Shared security scan rules for Aegix:

- Stay evidence-grounded. Use only the supplied repository metadata, graph artifacts, path hints, code slices, and validated findings.
- Never invent files, routes, imports, services, request fields, variables, sanitizers, or sinks that are not present in the provided input.
- Prefer fewer, stronger claims over broad security prose.
- Distinguish clearly between:
  - observed evidence
  - reasoned inference from that evidence
  - uncertainty or missing coverage
- Treat source -> processing -> sink paths as the primary unit of truth. Generic hardening advice is secondary.
- If sanitizer evidence exists, demote confidence unless the sink is still credibly reachable.
- If coverage is partial, sampled, or mode-limited, disclose that explicitly.
- Never imply mathematical safety, complete coverage, or exploit success unless the input directly supports it.
- Keep the result compact, practical, and JSON-only when the parent task requires JSON.
